section_1.title: What is it?
section_1.paragraph_1: >
  The <strong>CoopCycle</strong> project aims to create an <strong>open-source</strong> meal delivery platform,
  offering the same features as proprietary platforms.
section_1.paragraph_2: >
  The idea is to <strong>decentralize</strong> this kind of services, so that in every city,
  bicycle drivers wishing to regroup into a collective and/or a cooperative
  can own the platform they are working for.

section_2.title: How is it different?
section_2.paragraph_1: >
  The <a href="https://github.com/coopcycle">code</a> is licensed under the <a href="https://wiki.p2pfoundation.net/Peer_Production_License">Peer Production License</a>,
  which means that it can only be used in the context of a company or a community belonging to its workers,
  and that all financial gains, surpluses, profits and benefits generated by the enterprise or the collective are allocated
  between the worker-owners.

  In 2016, the so-called collaborative economy began to show its limits :
  the company Take Eat Easy was placed in judicial liquidation,
  the strikes of the drivers of VTC multiplied,
  the working conditions of foodtech workers were denounced.
  </p>
  <p>
  It is time to regain power, to create a fairer Internet, more concerned about its users, and respectful of social rights.

  <h2>Towards a platform cooperativism</h2>

      In September 2016, Nathan Schneider proposed to
      <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/29/save-twitter-buy-platform-shared-ownership" target="_blank">buy Twitter by its users</a>,
      so that they could decide the orientations of the platform by themselves.
      </p>
      <p>Why not?</p>
      <p>
      The platforms of the sharing economy are presented as mere actors of relationship, and flee their social responsibilities.
      </p>
      <p>
      It is up to the workers on the platforms to decide on working conditions, tariffs and schedules, on a democratic and open model: this model exists, it is the cooperative.
      </p>
      <p>
      We believe that it is possible to easily create an open-source clone of the foodtech platforms, offering the same level of quality, in order to offer the possibility to cooperatives of workers to set up.

  <h2>Think smaller, think local</h2>
  <p>
  By 2030, the Web alone could represent the equivalent of the 2008 world energy consumption.<br>
  Recently, W3C launched the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/wwca/">Web We Can Afford</a> working group,
  to address these issues in the context of the upcoming energy crisis.
  </p>
  <p>
  We believe that the delivery of meals by bike is a local activity, specific to each city.<br>
  It is possible to relocate this type of activity in the form of cooperatives, each cooperative hosting the platform on its own.<br>
  This should drastically reduce infrastructure costs and therefore energy consumption, while avoiding the centralization of data.
