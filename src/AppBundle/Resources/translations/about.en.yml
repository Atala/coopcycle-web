section_1.title: What is it?
section_1.paragraph_1: >
  The <strong>CoopCycle</strong> project aims to create an <strong>open-source</strong> meal delivery platform,
  offering the same features as proprietary platforms.
section_1.paragraph_2: >
  The idea is to <strong>decentralize</strong> this kind of services, so that in every city,
  bicycle drivers wishing to regroup into a collective and/or a cooperative
  can own the platform they are working for.

section_2.title: How is it different?
section_2.paragraph_1: >
  The <a href="https://github.com/coopcycle">code</a> is licensed under the <a href="https://wiki.p2pfoundation.net/Peer_Production_License">Peer Production License</a>,
  which means that it can only be used in the context of a company or a community belonging to its workers,
  and that all financial gains, surpluses, profits and benefits generated by the enterprise or the collective are allocated
  between the worker-owners.
