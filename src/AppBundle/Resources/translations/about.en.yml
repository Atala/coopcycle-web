section_1.title: An ecosystem
section_1.paragraph_1: >
  We believe it is possible to organize at a city level in the form of a co-operative of couriers,
  and provide a human-scale, environmentally conscious urban logistics service.
  <br><br>
  We create an order/dispatch system that you can set up and <strong>host yourself</strong>,
  on your own server, and a smartphone app that will allow connecting to any server running the platform.
  <br><br>
  We want, through local collective experiences, to build a knowledge base that will allow the model
  to be replicated easily.

section_2.title: A digital common
section_2.paragraph_1: >
  We want to provide those who organize themselves with a technological base, without any prior investment in research and development.
  <br><br>
  The only thing we ask for in return?
  <br>
  <strong>Create a worker owned co-operative.</Strong>

  In 2016, the so-called collaborative economy began to show its limits :
  the company Take Eat Easy was placed in judicial liquidation,
  the strikes of the drivers of VTC multiplied,
  the working conditions of foodtech workers were denounced.
  </p>
  <p>
  It is time to regain power, to create a fairer Internet, more concerned about its users, and respectful of social rights.
  </p>

  <h2>Towards a platform cooperativism</h2>

      In September 2016, Nathan Schneider proposed to
      <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/29/save-twitter-buy-platform-shared-ownership" target="_blank">buy Twitter by its users</a>,
      so that they could decide the orientations of the platform by themselves.
      </p>
      <p>Why not?</p>
      <p>
      The platforms of the sharing economy are presented as mere actors of relationship, and flee their social responsibilities.
      </p>
      <p>
      It is up to the workers on the platforms to decide on working conditions, tariffs and schedules, on a democratic and open model: this model exists, it is the cooperative.
      </p>
      <p>
      We believe that it is possible to easily create an open-source clone of the foodtech platforms, offering the same level of quality, in order to offer the possibility to cooperatives of workers to set up.

  <h2>Think smaller, think local</h2>
  <p>
  By 2030, the Web alone could represent the equivalent of the 2008 world energy consumption.<br>
  Recently, W3C launched the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/wwca/">Web We Can Afford</a> working group,
  to address these issues in the context of the upcoming energy crisis.
  </p>
  <p>
  We believe that the delivery of meals by bike is a local activity, specific to each city.<br>
  It is possible to relocate this type of activity in the form of cooperatives, each cooperative hosting the platform on its own.<br>
  This should drastically reduce infrastructure costs and therefore energy consumption, while avoiding the centralization of data.
